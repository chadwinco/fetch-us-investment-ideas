  default_prompt: "Use $fetch-us-investment-ideas as an LLM-first operator. Create SCREEN_RUN_ID in strict format YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS (no suffixes/slugs). Start with Finviz by running scripts/fetch_us_investment_ideas.py to build candidate context. If Finviz options fit the user query, apply --selection-json (prefer --selection-json - via stdin) and append final rows to <DATA_ROOT>/idea-screens/<SCREEN_RUN_ID>/screener-results.jsonl. If Finviz options do not fit, use web search in the outer loop to source ideas and still write final rows to the same screener-results.jsonl file. When present, use <DATA_ROOT>/user_preferences.md as free-form context in the outer-loop LLM. After successful append, sidecar artifacts should be cleaned unless --keep-artifacts is explicitly requested. Required keys: ticker, exchange_country=US. Preferred keys: company, exchange, sector, industry, market, thesis."
